## HW 1: SIR and SEIR Model Implementation for Pandemic Spread 
The objective is to implement and analyze the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) compartmental model to understand the dynamics of infectious disease spread.

### SIR model simulation
This plot simulates the SIR model over a period of 150 days with the following initial conditions
and parameters for a total population of N = 1000 individuals:

• Initial populations: S(0) = 999, I(0) = 1, R(0) = 0,
• Transmission rate: β = 0.3 × 10−3,
• Recovery rate: γ = 0.1.
